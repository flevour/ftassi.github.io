## About me

I'm a freelance web developer that like to work with [great people](http://www.ideato.it).
I'm curious about agile software development and XP methods. I'm definitely addicted to TDD since the first reading of "[Test-Driven Development By Example](http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-By-Example/dp/0321146530)" 
by Kent Beck(perhaps the most influential reading of my professional life) and I've embraced refactoring philosophy since then. Most of my professional life revolves around [Symfony framework](http://www.symfony.com) and [open 
source stuff](https://github.com/ftassi).

I love teaching and sharing my knowledge, hence the idea to found [screenfony.com](http://www.screenfony.com), a Symfony tutorial based startup which is my first real try as entrepreneur.

### The nomadic lifestyle

From time to time I like to put some stuff in a backpack and drag my laptop and my girlfriend around the world. 
[Internet is not just for porn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWEjvCRPrCo), it allows me to work remotely and so I do.
In 2012 I've spent a few months in Edinburgh, and now I'm plannig to move to Las Palmas in September (for a warm winter).
