It's been a nice (and short) summer, and **it's time to move again**.
Some time ago we (me and my girlfriend) decided to travel around the world, but just travelling was not enough for us, we wantend to "live" in a new place for a while. When you move to a new city for living and not just for sightseeing you get to know a completely different story than as a tourist. **We wanted that point of view**.

So we moved to Edinburgh from May 2012 to February 2013. In mid February we were back to Italy. We spent the all summer here, with friends and family, {"and now is backpack time again."}

From the 26th of September we'll move to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. For how long? Who knows, best case scenario is until April 2014, but we could come back quicker if Monica won't be able to find a decent job down there. 

A brand new adventure is about to start and I'm quite excited about it, but this is not really the point of this post.

I'm writing this for 2 main reasons:

## 1 - Nothing's impossible

Every time (not every, but around 90%) I tell someone that I'm leaving the reaction is something like "OH man!! You're so lucky, I wish I could do the same". 

You know what? I'm not that lucky, I'm just making this happen, and if you want to do the same you should too. I'm not the best at what I do, I'm not a rock star, I'm not rich and I'm not "extra" anything, I'm just a guy and I'm doing it, so if you want to, you can do it too.

I guess the first step is knowing what you want, and everything else comes after that. 

## 2 - Want to live in Italy for a while ?

Get in touch with me. I can rent you my place while I'm in Spain (or we can plan a home exchange for next year). If you're a developer chances are that you will be able to work and live at my place, 'cause I was doing it before you ;). I recently built a [coworking space](http://www.cowo42.com) with some collegues of mine and you'll be able to use my desk for all the time, working with some of the [greatest guys](http://www.cowo42.com/#coworkers) around here.

I guess I don't have to say nothing [about the coffe](http://www.nespresso.com/) that you'll find ;)
