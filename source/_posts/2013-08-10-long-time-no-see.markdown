I have to admin it: *I haven't been an active blogger in the last year*. Not really because I don't enjoy writing nor for lack of time and motivation, I guess many of reasons that kept me away from this blog are not real, they are just excuses and so **I decided to change**.

From today I'll try to bring this blog to a new life, sharing something about me, and some lessons I've learned (about PHP and maybe about my *real* life). 

Starting from scratch is always thrilling, what is the best way to enjoy it if not using some new technologies? So I've decided to get rid of the good old wordpress website and build this new one using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) and [github pages](http://pages.github.com/). Just writing markdown and deploying through a git push sounds like a lot of fun, but it is not just this, it is more a matter of being focused on content instead of dealing with a CMS. Wordpress is really easy to use, and it works just fine, but git is a part of my daily workflow and using it also for blogging feels way more natural, let's see how it will work.

That's all for now, this is just kind of a *hello world* post. 

*By the way, you'll get all the code of this blog on [github](https://github.com/ftassi/ftassi.github.io.git), if you found any error or typo, please fork and edit the post. Thank you so much!
