I realized that I'm kind of a monogamous freelance. It took me some time to get this but I'm feeling that it is quite an achievement. I wouldn't probably call it an **epiphany**, but it always feels good when you realize something new about yourself.

I've been freelancing for the last 11 years and I went through very different steps on my career. At the very beginnig I was kind of a **one man band**, like many others guys, trying to get a job out of my laptop. I was working for small customers, learning by mistakes, loosing money, getting money, putting out first crappy websites (Oh boy... that was fun :D). 

After a while I started looking for something different, more stimulating, and I had a chance to work for several different companies. All of them were unique and different, but all those jobs had a thing in common: long term relantionship.

I was part of a stable team for a medium to long period of time (at least, months) and even if I didn't realize it at the time, that was really really cool (both for me and for them).

For a very long time I thought that becoming a successfull freelance was a matter of getting as many clients as possible, taking good jobs but also working for different customers, seeking for new opportunities and never refuse one. While I was working for a major single customer I was also looking for side jobs, I really thought that that was the way to go. 

I was getting 90% of the benefits (I'd say value) that was coming from jobs from my main customer, but still I was putting so much effort to get the other 10%. {"Instead of focussing on the most valuable thing, I was struggling with meaningless others."} 
{% endpullquote %}

I'm now working only for one customer and I'll stick with it for some time (as long as it will feel right for both of us, I guess). I'm not working **for** them, I'm working **with** them. This is not possible for every team, but when you find the right team it can become delightful.

With such a long term collaboration you:

* trust and get trusted more
* you can focus on doing your job (wethever it is) instead of searching for a new one
* you can even avoid time spent on defining contracts (yes, I've been working for the last 2 years without a contract and I'm totally fine with it)
* you can be more efficient and more productive. Human relationships are quite difficult and also critical for our job. Well knowing the environment you're going to work in is a key factor on being an efficient part of it.
* you can learn more
* you can have fun

And counting. I could write about advantages of this forever. 

I'm not saying that it is the only way to go, but for sure it is a good way to go. I guess my "lesson learned" on this topic is there is no "only way", everyone should try and find out his "best way". For me, **so far**, the best way I can see is working for one company at the time.

Right now I've found a [really good bunch of guys to work with][ideato], which I share some values with, and I'll try to follow their path for a while (I want to talk about [life in ideato][ideato] in a later post).

Some freelance may be **concerned about loosing "grip" with their market**, loosing the ability to find new customers whenever they will have to. 

*Frankly, I'm not*.

Yes, one single customer can be considered a bit risky but if you really can create a binding made by *mutual advantages* that kind of risk is not an issue. Plus I'm not cutting all my relationships with the communities I'm involved in, so when I'll need a new job I'm pretty sure I'll find one ([black swan][black-swan] anyone?). 

In the meantime, if you really nead a [Symfony developer][ftassi] and want to hire me, you can [*think about hiring us*][ideato] ;).

Having a single team committment allows me to be more focussed on what I'm doing and leaves me more time to contribute to open source projects or build a portfolio that will stand for me when I'll need it. I'm happy with this configuration at the moment, and I'm feeling that the right thing for me is to stick with it for a while.
